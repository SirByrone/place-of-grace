# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## The Problem
Your GitHub Pages site wasn't updating because you were missing the automated deployment workflow. GitHub Pages needs to know how to build and deploy your React app.

## The Solution
I've set up two deployment methods for you:

### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
I've created a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically deploy your site whenever you push changes to the `main` branch.

**What I've added:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Automated deployment workflow
- The workflow will:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Build your React app
  3. Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically

### Method 2: Manual Deployment
I've also created a `deploy.sh` script for manual deployments.

## How to Deploy Your Changes

### Option A: Automatic (Recommended)
1. **Push your changes to the main branch:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Check the deployment:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on the "Actions" tab
   - You should see a workflow running called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   - Wait for it to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

3. **Your site will be live at:**
   `https://sirbyrone.github.io/place-of-grace`

### Option B: Manual Deployment
If you prefer manual control:

1. **Run the deployment script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

## GitHub Pages Settings
Based on your screenshot, make sure your GitHub Pages settings are:

1. **Source:** Deploy from a branch
2. **Branch:** `gh-pages` (this will be created automatically by the workflow)
3. **Folder:** `/ (root)`

## Troubleshooting

### If your changes still don't appear:

1. **Check the Actions tab:**
   - Go to your repository → Actions tab
   - Look for failed workflows
   - Check the logs for errors

2. **Force a rebuild:**
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Force rebuild"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private mode

4. **Wait a few minutes:**
   - GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update

### Common Issues:

1. **Build fails:** Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
2. **404 errors:** Make sure the `homepage` field in `package.json` matches your GitHub Pages URL
3. **Assets not loading:** Ensure all images and files are in the `public` folder

## File Structure
Your project structure should be:
```
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml          # Auto-deployment workflow
├── Website/
│   ├── src/                    # Your React source code
│   ├── public/                 # Static assets
│   ├── build/                  # Built files (auto-generated)
│   └── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
├── deploy.sh                   # Manual deployment script
└── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md        # This file
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these new files to your repository
2. Your next push to `main` will trigger the automatic deployment
3. Check the Actions tab to see the deployment progress
4. Your site should update automatically from now on!

## Need Help?
If you're still having issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
2. Make sure your repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)
3. Verify that GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings
