            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Place of Grace Children's Home was founded in 2009 with a simple yet powerful mission: 
              to provide love, care, and hope for orphaned and vulnerable children. What started as a 
              small initiative has grown into a comprehensive care facility that has touched hundreds of lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey began when our founder, the late Penina Kioko, witnessed the plight of children 
              living on the streets and in unsafe conditions. Moved by compassion, he established 
              a safe haven where these children could find love, education, and a chance for a better future.
